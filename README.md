# terraform-projects
This repository would contain terraform code that I created for various purposes such as learning, experimenting, understanding best practices etc. The code would be organized into various folders depending on the purpose such as creating a single EC2 instance in AWS, deploying multiple EC2 instances in different regions etc. I would start with AWS, but later would aim to experiment in Azure and Google Cloud.

The terrafom code would be updated from time to time as I learn more on terraform, understand best ways to organise it, learn how to write them efficiently such as reducing duplicate code etc. At other times you may find some terraform code that's just random that I may have written quickly to spin up something.
